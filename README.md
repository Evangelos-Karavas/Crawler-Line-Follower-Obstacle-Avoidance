# Crawler-Line Follower-Obstacle Avoidance
Assignment for NTUA: Mehcatronics Systems

This assignment was from:
Evangelos Karavas, 
Christos Tsikalakis

This crawler robot is a line follower with two infrared sensors to stay in-between the black line that it has to follow, and
with a front IR sensor we can detect objects that are in front of the black line. The robot can make the decision to turn
right or left depending if the object ahead of it is more to the left or the right, and if the object is too large the robot
takes a bigger turn to the right.


# Code
In the folder line_follow_obst_avoid you can find the Arduino code for the project.


# Report

There is also a report giving information about the motors, drive and materials used to complete the project.
There also is a schematic of the electronics connected so it is easier for the user to complete the project
without having different connections than the ones used in the Arduino code.
