# Crawler-Line Follower-Obstacle Avoidance
Assignment for NTUA: Mehcatronics Systems

This assignment was from:
Evangelos Karavas, 
Christos Tsikalakis

This crawler robot is a line follower with two infrared sensors to stay in-between the black line that it has to follow, and
with a front IR sensor we can detect objects that are in front of the black line. The robot can make the decision to turn
right or left depending if the object ahead of it is more to the left or the right, and if the object is too large the robot
takes a bigger turn to the right.
